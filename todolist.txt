To do list:
- Implement a function that determines if the game is over 
- Finish item classes
- Incorporate Inheritance


NOTE on file dependency:

adventure is the highest in the hierarchy and thus world, location, player, and item may not
access any of its variables



adventure relies on (world + location + player_and_items) as a dependency

world relies on (location) as a dependency

location relies on (item) as a dependency

player has items dependency

location and player are on same level of hierarchy

item.use should be able to change the state of a location



key.use: checks if player is in correct room (Bahen). then world.

player.use:

checks if in inventory, then checks if item can be used in this room
  if conditions met, then call item.use

flowers.use: None type method that prints Fairgrieves message



item.use


Enhancement ideas:

1. puzzles:
- 'Search' garbage can to find key that unlocks CSSU lounge, CSSU lounge has your Tcard and ONE ICE CREAM
- give ice cream to suspicious guy, tells you to 'search UTAT rocket' in Myhal, this command puts
PEN in inventory if you're in Myhal
- give flowers to fairgrieve to tell you the correct answer to ilias riddle
- you answer ilias riddle correctly, and then it puts cheat sheet in your inventory
